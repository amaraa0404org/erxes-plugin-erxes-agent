 * library-sanctioned `connectorHandler` seam instead of re-reading MONGO_URL,
 * so there is exactly one Mongo client per process. Collections resolve
 * against a dedicated `{baseDb}_agents_memory` database (derived, not

 * is muddled by, the platform's own legacy Mastra collections. The
 * connection's lifecycle is owned by the platform (`erxes-api-shared/utils`
 * connect()), so `close()` is intentionally a no-op.
