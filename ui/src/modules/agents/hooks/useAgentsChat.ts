 * - automatic resend after an approval decision via the SDK's native
 *   `sendAutomaticallyWhen` predicate (the transport routes that resend to
 *   the backend's `/agents/approve` resume endpoint),
 * - active run id tracking for reconnect: generated per normal send,
 *   persisted per thread in sessionStorage (one shared entry per thread
 *   — a durable run belongs to the thread, not the surface), cleared on
 *   clean completion and on terminal errors (via `onFinish`), retained
 *   only on abort, disconnect, or a pending approval/ask_user suspension
 *   so reconnectable streams can resume under the same run,
 * - surface-scoped session restore: the selected thread id persists per
 *   `sessionScope` (`page` vs `widget`), so a browser refresh reopens
 *   the same conversation through `openThread` (which resumes a stored
 *   live run, and re-reads the thread once after a non-replayed resume
 *   so a run that finished during the reload still shows its reply)
